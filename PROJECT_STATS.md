# Open Game Panel - Project Statistics

## Codebase Analysis

### Size and Complexity
- **Total PHP Files**: 2,185 files
- **Lines of Code**: ~150,000+ lines of PHP code
- **Modules**: 40+ functional modules
- **Languages**: 20+ language packs
- **Themes**: Multiple theme options including AdminLTE

### File Distribution
```
modules/          # Core functionality modules (~70% of code)
includes/         # Core libraries and utilities
lang/            # Internationalization files
themes/          # User interface themes
js/              # JavaScript libraries
css/             # Stylesheets
```

### Module Breakdown
The codebase is highly modular with these major components:

**Core Modules:**
- `server` - Game server management (largest module)
- `gamemanager` - Game definitions and templates
- `user_games` - User server assignments
- `administration` - System administration
- `settings` - Configuration management

**Feature Modules:**
- `ftp` / `litefm` - File management
- `mysql` - Database management
- `backup-restore` - Server backup functionality
- `rcon` - Remote console access
- `tickets` - Support system
- `billing` - Payment processing
- `teamspeak3` - TS3 server management

**Utility Modules:**
- `util` - System utilities
- `status` - Server monitoring
- `news` - News management
- `support` - Help system
- `extras` - Additional tools

### Code Quality Indicators

**Positive Aspects:**
- Well-organized modular structure
- Extensive language support
- Comprehensive feature set
- Active development history

**Areas for Improvement:**
- Mixed coding standards across modules
- Legacy PHP patterns (pre-PSR standards)
- Limited automated testing
- Security practices need modernization

### Complexity Assessment
- **High Complexity**: Large codebase with deep interdependencies
- **Learning Curve**: Significant time needed to understand full system
- **Maintenance**: Requires careful coordination due to agent dependencies
- **Testing**: Manual testing currently required for most changes

This analysis confirms the complexity mentioned in the original request and validates the need for comprehensive documentation and careful improvement planning.
